## Local Weather App Project

### Note:

Rename the .dist to config.js and edit it's content by replacing the data with your own data.

### Project Guidelines

The aim for this project was to build a web app that shows the user their local weather. Atleast one relevant API was required to retrieve or fetch data like:

- Temperature
- City name
- Weather description
- Wind Speed and More.

The completed web applictaion should meet these needs/requirements:

- Show weather in user's current location
- There is a weather description with icon or image
  (Example: sunny, snowy, rain ..etc)
- User can click on a button to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius

_Extra Features added by me: - User can search for any City's weather; Radom related image is shown for each City._

### Project Approach

For this project, I had to use two API's to obtain the weather data, one by cordinates (prompts to allow location), the other by city search.

I first started by designing the UI and got it to work with HTML and CSS. Once I completed that, I started adding functionality (one-by-one) with JavaScript.

I connected to the API, to get the weather data to be displayed on the screen. Next I would add the button to convert between fahrenheit and celsius. I added the CSS graphics to be displayed, depending on what result came from the user's location. Lastly I made the background Image change depending on the City that was returned or searched. I also verified that everything worked properly, including on various screen sizes.

### Made with

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Design inspired by [David Nowak](https://www.youtube.com/c/davidnowak) and [Jonah Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCipSxT7a3rn81vGLw9lqRkg)
